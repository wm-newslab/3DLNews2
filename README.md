# 3DLNews-2.0: A Three-decade Dataset of US Local News Articles

## 1. Overview 
We present 3DLNews-2.0, an expanded version of the 3DLNews repository, featuring significant enhancements and broader coverage. Key highlights include:
- A collection of U.S. local news articles spanning nearly three decades, from 1995 to 2024.
- Over 8 million URLs (including HTML text), with a refined subset of more than 4 million filtered news article URLs.
- Coverage of article URLs from over 14,000 local newspapers, TV stations, and radio broadcasters across all 50 states, offering a comprehensive view of the U.S. local news landscape.
- Data gathered through an extended scraping process using Google and Twitter search results, building on the original 3DLNews scraping methodology.
- A rigorous multi-step filtering pipeline was employed to exclude non-news links and enhance the dataset with rich metadata, such as: names and geographic coordinates of the source media organizations, article publication dates and other relevant metadata.
- Demonstrated applications of the 3DLNews-2.0 dataset across four use cases, showcasing its versatility.

## 3. 3DLNews Dataset

### 3.1 Local news media dataset
We used an extended version of the Local Memory Project's (LMP) US local news dataset to get the local news media outlets. LMP's dataset consists of the websites of 5,993 local newspapers, 2,539 TV stations, and 1,061 radio stations, primarily extracted from [thepaperboy.com](thepaperboy.com) in 2016. We extended it by crawling and scraping [thepaperboy.com](thepaperboy.com) (again), [web.archive.org/web/20221203031956/http://www.usnpl.com/](web.archive.org/web/20221203031956/http://www.usnpl.com/), [50states.com](50states.com), and [einpresswire.com/world-media-directory/3/united-states](einpresswire.com/world-media-directory/3/united-states). Table 1 outline the number of local news media outlets that we have used to extract local news articles. The `broadcast` type refers to either TV or radio stations, because we could not accurately distinguish them during scraping.

The  improved local news media outlets dataset can be downloaded from here: [usa_2016_2024_pu5e.json.gz](https://github.com/wm-newslab/3DLNews/blob/main/resources/usa_2016_2024_pu5e.json.gz)

**Table 1:  US local news media dataset.**

| Media Type | Number of websites |
|------------|---------------------|
| Newspapers | 9,441               |
| Radio      | 2,449               |

| TV         | 886                 |
| **Total**  | **14,086**          |

We issued Google and Twitter search queries to their respective search engines and scraped their links. For Google, we created queries from 1995 – 2024, for Twitter, 2006 – 2024. Table 2
presents the number of links scraped from Google and Twitter for each media type.

### 3.2 Data Filtering

The collected URLs from Google and Twitter scraping could include both news and non-news article links. Below, we outline our filtering process for removing non-news article URLs from 3DLNews. Since there is no universal standard URL format for news articles, we have also provided access to the raw data, allowing researchers to implement their own filtering methods. Our process was informed by an experiment in which we developed a gold-standard dataset of news article URLs to understand two key properties: **path depth** and **word-boundary**.

- **Path Depth**: The path depth of a URL refers to the number of hierarchies in its path property. For example:
  - `https://example.com/` has a path depth of 0.
  - `https://example.com/foo` has a path depth of 1.
  - `https://example.com/foo/bar` has a path depth of 2.
  
- **Word-Boundary**: A word-boundary is a symbol that separates words in a URL. For example:
  - In the URL `https://example.com/this-is-a-page`, the word-boundary is `-`.

### Filtering Process

The filtering process consisted of the following steps:

1. **Dereferencing URLs**: 
   - All URLs were dereferenced to resolve redirects and retrieve their final forms.

2. **Domain Matching**:
   - Links with domains not present in our local news media dataset were discarded.

3. **Normalization**:
   - URLs were converted to lowercase, trailing slashes were removed, and duplicates were eliminated.

4. **Path Depth Filtering**:
   - URLs with a path depth of 0 (typically homepages) were removed.
   - All URLs with a path depth of 3 or greater were retained.

5. **Word-Boundary Filtering**:
   - URLs with a path depth of less than 3 were retained if they contained popular word-boundary separators such as `-`, `_`, or `.`.
   - For example: `http://kwgs.org/post/funeral-set-ou-quarterback-killed-crash`.

**Table 3: 3DLNews: Number of news article URLs (non-news URLs excluded)**

Here is the updated table in Markdown format, showing only the "Filtered" columns:

### 3.3 Data Enrichment 

We enhanced the usefulness of the news article URLs in 3DLNews by adding attributes to each URL. Table 4 outlines the complete list of attributes.

The Google directory contains JSONL files with news article URLs extracted through Google scraping. Each JSONL file represents a collection of URLs and their associated metadata gathered from automated searches on Google.

The Twitter directory holds JSONL files with news article URLs obtained via Twitter scraping. Each JSONL file includes URLs and metadata collected from tweets, providing a diverse set of news articles shared on the Twitter platform.

Within both the Twitter and Google directories, there are three main directories for each news media type. Inside each media type folder, the following main directories are included:

- **state:** Contains scraped data for each state for each year.
- **preprocessed_data:** Contains directories for each state. Within each state directory, there are jsonl.gz files for each year, which include data objects for each URL with metadata.
